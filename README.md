# ExecuteBinaryTree
Execute the arithmetic operations in a binary tree

The idea is that you are working with another software
developer. She will take care of a part of the project
delivering a binary tree. You need to evaluate the binary
tree and return the result.

If interested in the description of the problem and my
comments I invite you to read the following post in my
blog:

Keep in mind that on eof the best ways to learn is to
read and experiment.

Enjoy;
